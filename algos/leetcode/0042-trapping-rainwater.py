# Trapping Rain Water - Solution Progression

## Core Principle
Water at position i is trapped up to: **min(max_left, max_right) - height[i]**

---

## Approach 1: BFS Draining from Edges
**Thinking:** Water escapes from edges. Use BFS to see which cells can drain at each level.

**Insight discovered:** The edges are the only escape routes. Water level is determined by the shortest boundary to reach an edge.

**Complexity:** O(nm) time/space where m = max height

---

## Approach 2: Two Pointers from Edges
**Thinking:** If edges control everything, just track the two boundary heights.

**Key realization:** We don't need to know BOTH boundaries exactly - only which one is smaller.
- If left_max < right_max: the right side is "tall enough", so left_max limits position left
- If right_max < left_max: the left side is "tall enough", so right_max limits position right

**Process:** Start at both edges, maintain max heights seen, move the pointer with smaller boundary inward.

**Complexity:** O(n) time, O(1) space

---

## Bridge: BFS â†’ Two Pointers

1. **BFS shows:** Edges are the critical boundaries
2. **Simplify:** For 1D, only two edges exist - track their max heights
3. **Optimize:** Instead of precomputing all maxes, maintain them as you process from both ends simultaneously
4. **Final insight:** Always process the side with the smaller boundary - it's the limiting factor

---

## Remember
- Water escapes over the shorter wall
- We process from edges inward because edges give us certainty about boundaries
- Moving the smaller boundary guarantees the other side is "protective enough"
- Water is ultimately trapped in some 'valley'. We can use two-pointers to
  construct sub problems to find at each index the relevant 'valley'.
