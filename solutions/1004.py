"""
Given a list of numbers L, implement a method sum(i, j) which returns the sum from
the sublist L[i:j] (including i, excluding j).

For example, given L = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], sum(1, 3) should return sum([2, 3]), which is 5.

You can assume that you can do some pre-processing. sum() should be optimized over
the pre-processing step.

We will be sending the solution tomorrow, along with tomorrow's question. As alway
, feel free to shoot us an email if there's anything we can help with.

Have a great day!
