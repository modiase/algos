"""
Suppose we wish not only to increment a counter but also to reset it to zero (i.e.,
make all bits in it 0). Counting the time to examine or modify a bit as â€š.1/,
show how to implement a counter as an array of bits so that any sequence of n
INCREMENT and RESET operations takes time O.n/ on an initially zero counter.
(Hint: Keep a pointer to the high-order 1.)
