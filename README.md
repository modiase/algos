## Purpose

Improve my competence and confidence with algorithmic coding questions.

## Review Notes

Every question should include a comment with a notes section.
The review section should include:

- C - Completed: Yes (Y) or No (N) depending on whether I was able to complete the question
  without looking up a solution
- T - Time spent: The time in minutes I spent working on the question until I either completed
  it or gave up. If I worked on a question in multiple sessions then a comma seperated list can
  be given - e.g., 5,15,5 means I worked on it for 25 minutes total in 3 sessions.
- PD - Personal Difficulty - How difficult I found the problem from 1 (easy) - 5 (very hard).
- Obviously, any question not completed without assistance is automatically a 5.
